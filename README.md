## Background

While the development of unmanned systems is accelerating due to the COVID-19 virus, many stores have already introduced and are using unmanned systems such as kiosks. However, the problem of increased waiting time due to the limited number of kiosks as well as the inexperience of the elderly in using kiosks is appearing one after another.

The goals for this repository are:

Instead of a kiosk with a limited quantity and complicated usage, the application is used to place an order and payment through a mobile phone through the QR code attached to each table in the store, aiming to reduce the waiting time for users and order.

Main features of the application:

1. It uses the **map API** to search for nearby stores and stores that meet the conditions and displays them on the screen. [NAVER Maps](https://www.ncloud.com/product/applicationService/maps)
2. **Check the menu**, information, prices, etc. of the selected store
3. Check the real-time **seat status** of the selected store
4. Order using the **QR code** attached to the table in the store

## Usage

1. Run the spring server in the server file.
2. Run the application of the client file with AVD or mobile phone.
